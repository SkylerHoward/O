 O

Hi! This is O, my assistant hobby project. There are a few things you need to do before you're able to use O, but it's not too difficult. You just need to install all the pre-requisites, and edit a couple lines of code.

# Pre-requisites

You need to install:
    pyttsx3
    pyowm

(Please tell me if any other modules actually need installing...)

# Lines of code to edit

weather.py, Line 13: You need to change the API Key to the API key you get from OWM. I'm not letting you use mine.
            Line 15: You need to change the location from "LOCATION" to somewhere more accurate. If you don't, it will just chuck errors at you, and nobody likes that.

That's all.

Just a note though, with events.py, for that to work you need to get the Google Calendar API whatever up and running...
